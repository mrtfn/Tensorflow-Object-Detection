Want to get up to speed on AI powered Object Detection but not sure where to start?

Want to start building your own deep learning Object Detection models?

Need some help detecting stuff for your course, startup or business?

This is the course you need!

In this course, you’ll learn everything you need to know to go from beginner to practitioner when it comes to deep learning object detection with Tensorflow. This course mainly revolves around Python but there’s a little Javascript thrown in as well when it comes to building a web app in Project 2. But don’t fret we’ll take it step by step so you can take your time and work through it. All the code it made available through GitHub, links below.  

As part of this course you’ll build four different object detection models:
A. Gesture Detection - this is the first project where you’ll be able to build a model that detects four different gestures
B. Microscope Based Defect Detection - here we’ll leverage a USB microscope to detect defects in LEDs and PCBs using TFOD and Python
C. Web Direction Detection - in this model you’ll learn how to detect hand directions for integration in a React Js Web App with Tensorflow Js
D. Face Sentiment Detection - here you’ll learn how to estimate facial sentiment using Tensorflow Object Detection on a Raspberry Pi with TFLite


You’ll learn how to:
1. Install Tensorflow Object Detection on a Local Machine and on Colab
2. Collect and Label images for Object Detection using LabelImg
3. Train Deep Learning powered Object Detection Models using Python and TFOD
4. Detect objects in real time using a webcam and using Images
5. Tune Object Detection models to improve Precision and Recall
6. Export your model to Tensorflow JS for integration in React JS web apps
7. Export your model to TFLite for use on a Raspberry Pi
